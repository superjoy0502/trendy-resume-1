## 🏗 Make one for youself!

### 1. Duplicate this repository
You can just clone this repo to your account, or [use this repo as a template](https://github.com/junhoyeo/trendy-resume/generate)!

### 2. Development on your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-nickname/some-repository.git
# this clone link is from the repo that you generated at the previous step!

cd some-repository
# move to your newly cloned folder

yarn
# to install dependencies
# of course, you can use npm
# - but just be sure to delete yarn.lock because it'll be useless if then

yarn dev
# run the dev server in your local
```

### 3. Setup deployment

> ⚠️ This project uses Next.js for server-side rendering!!! ⚠️
>
> Keep this in mind while developing features related to paging, rendering, generating values etc. 👍

You can deploy to services that supports Next.js like [ZEIT](https://zeit.co/), Github Pages, Heroku.

### 4. Configurations
Now, look through the files and feel free to customize for yourself! 🔥

I'm still working on a more proper documentation and make more things customizable, so you can either wait, hack, or help me by contributing via [Issues](https://github.com/junhoyeo/trendy-resume/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/junhoyeo/trendy-resume/pulls)!

## 🍭 Sweet Tips
These are the materials I used for designing this blog.

| Service or Material | Description | Alternatives |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| [Zepeto](https://zepeto.me/) | You can easily make a cool avatar like youself, and take pictures | Maybe some facial-emoji solutions? |
| [Smartmockups](https://smartmockups.com/) | Some of the mockups was generated here. It's really great but trial version like mine includes a small watermark in the corner, also it's hard to find multiple device mockups with the same machine. | Photoshop is the best, really. |

Feel free to add yours too!
